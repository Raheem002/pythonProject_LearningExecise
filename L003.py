#Take 2 integer number from user and add them

#number1 = input('Give a number to add')
#number2 = input('Give a number to add')
#result = number1 + number2
#print(result)

#Now here it will act as concatination so we have to conter the str to int

#We have to convert the string in to integer by using int() command

number1 = input('Give a number to add')
number2 = input('Give a number to add')
result = int(number1) + int(number2)
print(result)

# '+' act as sum in the integers
# '+' act as concatination in the string
